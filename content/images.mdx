# Serving the right size of images

To serve a best user experience for the user, performance is doing a big role for that. We can simply using [img attribute sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) to help, so we can make sure user will only load an appropriate image size.

> The [sizes](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-5-sizes/) attribute in the HTML code should be adjusted to fit the actual dimensions in your page

## Using img sizes attribute

  sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px"
  srcset="

    dog_c_scale,w_832.jpg   832w,
